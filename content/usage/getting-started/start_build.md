If you've followed the documentation for [enabling a repo](/docs/usage/getting-started/enabling_repo/) and [writing a pipeline](/docs/usage/getting-started/write_pipeline/) all that should be left is to push your pipeline to your repo.

If a build does not trigger when your push a change to your repo, check the webhook response to see if there is an error.
