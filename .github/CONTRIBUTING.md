## Getting Started

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) - building block for local development

```

## Running the website locally

We use [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) to build our site.

You will need to install:

- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started) theme for Hugo

Docsy has some of it's own requirements, listed in their getting started docs.

- [PostCSS](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#install-postcss)
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` to update the submodule

Once you've got that taken care of, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server -w
```
